# Keyboard Study Project
For all details regarding this project, please refer to my detailed write-up!

## Short Summary
In the past, linear switches in mechanical keyboards have been marketed as a gaming switch while tactile switch variants have been catered towards a quality typing experience. However, modern marketing surrounding the mechanical keyboard industry focus heavily on delivering the keyboard as one product, marketing every type of switch under one umbrella of "gaming switches". As the project was being planned, it was realized as a good opportunity to look for any other correlations, and along with matplotlib and seaborn, introduce data analysis and visualization to the keyboard industry. The goal of this study/project was to see if this perception of tactile and linear switches remained, to look for any other additional correlations with switch preference in the market, as well as introduce data visualization and analysis to the mechanical keyboard scene.

This project primarily uses kernel density estimation in the form of a violin plot in order to make up for the small data sample. Results and analysis is purely theoretical and can be heavily skewed in one direction, however the results do support the perception of the two linear and tacile switch types.
